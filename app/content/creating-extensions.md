# Creating YT Video Saver and Copy Collector Extension

Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. People are gonna love using your stuff.

| Why Remix? |

Remix is a seamless server and browser runtime that provides snappy page loads and instant transitions by leveraging distributed systems and native browser features instead of clunky static builds. Built on the Web Fetch API (instead of Node) it can run anywhere. It already runs natively on Cloudflare Workers, the edge.

| Getting Started |

To create a new Remix project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-remix@latest my-remix-app
```

This will create a new Remix project in the my-remix-app directory. You can then navigate to that directory and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-remix-app
npm run dev
```

| Key Concepts |

Remix is built around a few key concepts:

- **Routes**: Remix uses a file-based routing system. Each file in the app/routes directory becomes a route in your application.
- **Loaders**: Loaders are functions that run on the server to load data for a route.
- **Actions**: Actions are functions that run on the server to handle form submissions.
- **Meta**: Meta functions allow you to set the title, description, and other meta tags for a route.

With these concepts, you can build powerful, dynamic web applications that are fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.
